## What I've Learned
This project has taught me about
- Spaghetti code: I've heard the term, and understood the concept, but never tasted the pasta. This project was big enough that I couldn't keep in my head at once how all the parts act and interact. I got into a hole of functions and variables, and every time I tried to fix one problem a new one cropped up out of nowhere. Meatballs of unexpected behavior were everywhere. 
- Objects: I've not really used them intentionally. I learned about making them interact, and still have a lot of questions. They didn't make it into the final product, as the refactor didn't turn out well and I was sinking too much time.
- Handling zeros. I ran into some logic problems when testing for empty numbers, as it's not super straightforward how to tell the difference between null and 0, for example. My solution ended up being to store the numbers in strings. This probably has it's own disadvantages, but it worked for this project. 
- Time... How long do I want to work on this, vs. get on to learning something new. There comes a point when I'm not learning anything, just fiddling and chasing bugs. I'm not sure how to balance the need to finish a project and see that it works vs. just moving on. (Obviously a production environment is much different. The purpose of this project is to learn, so that has to be the driving objective.)
